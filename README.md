# TankiShooter - A Simple Unity Game Made at School

Welcome to **TankiShooter**, a fast-paced game where you control a tank defending itself from waves of explosive cars that are determined to destroy you.

## Gameplay Overview

In **TankiShooter**, your objective is to avoid being hit by the explosive cars while maximizing the number of cars you shoot within a 2-minute time limit.

## Controls

- **Movement:** Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to steer your tank.
- **Shooting:** Your tank automatically fires at the nearest car.

## Objective

- **Survival:** Don't let any of the cars touch you.
- **High Score:** Shoot as many cars as you can in 2 minutes.

## Installation

Go to the Releases page and download the executable. As of now, TankiShooter is only availble on Linux.
